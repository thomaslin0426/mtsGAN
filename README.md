# mtsGAN
We proposed mtsGAN, based on cycleGAN to access interconversion between two platforms. We therefore tried two types of modeling approaches, 
with equal or unequal numbers of input and output genes. Here only demostrate equal number model. the In the real cycle data analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient, the mean square error,
and the dimensionality reduction analysis performance are taken for benchmarking. On the other hand, we tried a model with equal sizes of input and output genes,
which can converge steadily during the training process. The distance between the converted data in the dimensionality reduction analysis was also closer than 
that of the first model; in the real cycle data analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the mean square error have been greatly improved.
